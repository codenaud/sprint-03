# Sprint 03: Testing

## Introduction

A company in the audiovisual sector has asked us for a web application that will allow their employees to quickly find movies from a large database they have, since the process is currently done manually.

You will be in charge of setting up the core of the application: all the logic of filtering and sorting of movies. You have 2 weeks to finish, which is how long this sprint lasts.

## Description

Welcome to Sprint 03: Testing! This repository focuses on validating JavaScript functions to pass the tests outlined in Sprint 3. The primary goal is to test and ensure the accuracy and reliability of common array methods like map, filter, reduce, find, and more. By rigorously testing these functions, we aim to strengthen the codebase and enhance the overall quality of the JavaScript implementation.
